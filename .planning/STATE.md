# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-14)

**Core value:** Patient completes a clinically-accurate 3-day diary in their own timezone with their own routine and leaves with a clinician-ready export — no data loss, no UX friction, no privacy compromise.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Layout foundation + AppShell chrome (kicking off Desktop & Tablet UX milestone)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 8 (Layout foundation + AppShell chrome — planning in progress)
Plan: 0/TBD (UI-SPEC.md being generated, then `/gsd-plan-phase 5` produces plans)
Status: Stabilization milestone (Phases 1–4) is 3/4 complete (Phase 3 STAB-06/07/08 UX polish tail remains, deferred). Desktop & Tablet UX milestone (Phases 5–8) just added: 6 new requirements (DTUX-01–06), 4 new phases. Phase 5 establishes container/max-width tokens + AppShell desktop chrome (BottomNav → top-bar nav, FAB reposition, Header expansion). Phases 6–8 build on it.
Last activity: 2026-05-14 — Added Desktop & Tablet UX milestone to roadmap; planning Phase 5 with UI-SPEC.md gate.

Progress: [████░░░░░░] 44% (4 of 9 active phases complete; 1 in planning, 4 not started)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Stabilization milestone framing chosen — audit-driven bug fixes over new features.
- Init: Coarse phase granularity — 3 phases grouping the 8 STAB-* requirements by failure class.
- Init: Skip per-phase research — codebase map + memory + `docs/TIME_MODEL.md` are authoritative.
- 2026-05-14: Added Phase 4 (STAB-09) — IndexedDB backend swap chosen over encryption-at-rest; same privacy model, lower UX cost.
- 2026-05-14: Phase 4 shipped via planned route (`/gsd-plan-phase 4` → `/gsd-execute-phase 4`). 2 plans, 4 atomic commits, 389/389 tests pass. Verifier scored 2/4 automated + 2/4 post-merge manual (Safari ITP + walkthrough).
- 2026-05-14: Added Desktop & Tablet UX milestone (Phases 5–8, DTUX-01 through DTUX-06). New milestone scope: 4 phases ordered foundation → forms → per-page → polish. Decision to keep phase numbering monotonic (5–8 not 1–4 reset) so existing tooling and `padded_phase` directory naming stays consistent. UI-SPEC.md gate enabled for Phase 5 (frontend phase, design contract locks max-width tokens + breakpoint set + chrome behavior before planner runs).

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-05-14
Stopped at: Phase 4 + code-review follow-ups complete. After Phase 4 shipped, an inline code review (gsd-code-reviewer subagent 529'd; reviewer done inline) found 1 BLOCKING (notifications west-of-UTC tomorrow bug — regression I introduced via STAB-02), 1 HIGH (IDB-throws hides localStorage), 1 MEDIUM (DST drift in day-4 reminder), 1 LOW (JSDoc). Quick task 260514-ttr fixed all 4 with atomic commits (b0a7e4c, ca1dae6, 52c1c39, 091f802, 6c171eb). 413/413 vitest pass, tsc clean. Codex cross-AI review was attempted but Codex CLI is unauthenticated (refresh-token expired) — user said they'd re-auth and have me retry; deferred for now. Ready for `git push origin main` → Vercel auto-deploy when user confirms. Only Phase 3 (STAB-06/07/08 UX polish) remains in the Stabilization milestone.
